# Project Euler Solutions
These are my solutions to [Project Euler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

I thought these would be pretty fun to do, and of course I learn a lot by trying to find the most optimal solution for each one.

If you think one of my solutions could be done better, **(in a way that isn't just shortening the code and making it less readable)** then please go ahead and submit a pull request!
